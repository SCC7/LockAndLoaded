That includes a Versant, used by the Tolstaya as her personal flagship, as well as one Vapor and two Sleet frigates. They have also managed to obtain limited pirate production run versions of the Stratus and the Rime. \nThe group then raided several small Diable Avionics and Pirate convoys, causing large damage to stocks of certain companies and making a fool of few particular military officers. \nOur backers are not happy, so you will be paid for elimination of both Miss Tolstaya and the entirety of her warband.",

Eventually, this band of convicts was forged into a half-decent band of scumbags, more than capable of surviving the trivial patrols assigned to them./nOn their way back from a routine sortie, the penal unit conspired to kill the officer and seize control of the fleet.

If you command a small mercenary fleet, we wish to offer you a legally binding elimination contract. Cooperate with the Corporation interests, get handsomely rewarded, and be granted  profitable opportunities within Tri-Tachyon space in the future!.\nThere's a former task force fleet that went rogue and ran away with Tri-Tachyon goods, failing to uphold their contract terms.

Captain $name commands a Shrike-class destroyer as $hisOrHerOrTheir flagship. Caution is advised before engaging them in combat.\nLastly, if you happen to find any of the stolen items, bring them to any Tri-Tachyon Station Commander and you will be adequately rewarded for them.
