His term was beset by scandal and incompetance from the very beginning, but on the very eve of elections, he has disappeared with the entire treasury!\nFortunately, a few of us saw this coming and purchased Asymmetrical Justice Insurance a while back; half of the payout is yours if you can take him out. His name is Dante 'Fubar' Fresco.",
