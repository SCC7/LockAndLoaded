		"job_description":"Your target is Miss Tolstaya. She is a leader of the group calling itself Devilish Astronauts. According to our sources she took that position by defeating previous leader in combat, but we could not confirm that information. \nSince then, under her leadership, this group has obtained a few vessels made by the Diable Avionics. That includes a Versant, used by the Tolstaya as her personal flagship, as well as one Vapor and two Sleet frigates. They have also managed to obtain limited pirate production run versions of the Stratus and the Rime. \nThe group then raided several small Diable Avionics and Pirate convoys, causing large damage to stocks of certain companies and making a fool of few particular military officers. \nOur backers are not happy, so you will be paid for elimination of both Miss Tolstaya and the entirety of her warband.",
